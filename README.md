## Description
This is a small calculator project built with React, providing the 4 basic operators, numpad functionality, mobile usability and styled to replicate an old casio calculator. Instead of building the calculator around the use of the eval() function because of simplicity and security issues, I choose to instead follow a much more structured approach to the handeling of values and operators to evaluate answers.

## Technologies
* React

## Features
* Ability to add, subtract, divide and multiply.
* Calculating without using the eval() function.
* Numpad use.
* Styled to look like an old Casio calculator.

## Setup
If downloading the project run

`npm install`

to install the project and all the dependencies, followed by

`npm start`

to run the project on http://localhost:3000
