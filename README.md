### About
This is a small calculator project built with React, providing the 4 basic operators, numpad functionality, mobile usability and styled to replicate an old casio calculator. Instead of building the calculator around the use of the eval() function because of simplicity and security issues, I choose to instead follow a much more structured approach to the handeling of values and operators to evaluate answers.
